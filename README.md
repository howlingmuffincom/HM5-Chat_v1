# HM5-Chat_v1
The Next Level of development for the HM Website. The Website will be built around the chat. Fully object-oriented, prefectly capsuled and open-source so it can be used again.

The last times, the chat was fully integrated in the HM Website. But the code was always badly organized and partially copied from
old projects, which were even worse.

The current website has made some improvements, a better organization, a new look w/o that fu***ng bootstrap sh*t and a new chat system, developed on a single day. 
the current chat system also should have fixed the bug for messages getting lost or being doubled due to the timestsamp structure 
differences between client and server time used as the only way to organize messages.

The current chat system uses the internal ids to gather and order messages, but the problem still occurs. it may be caused by the very simple yet primitive 
structure of the project, anyways the current chat system is quite better than the old oe, but only a temporary fix.


the web project HM5 has no time limitations and has the only goal of being the perfect website. nothing else.
the chat system is planned to be the core system itself, with the website built around it but every part being isolated and partially
reusable. Every page should have the ability to interact / communicate with the chat system, and vice-versa. so the user gets notified 
of new messages, and gets them presented in an overview using which he can simply answer to every single user.

Face-to-Face conversations will still be used system, although group chats will be an option for every user. 


The website will have a user-level ranking system, which is parted from the user-permission-level and allows the user to unlock new features and additional
content and permissions as his rank gets higher.





Everything will be self-written using some minor functions from frameworks like jquery and materialize.
